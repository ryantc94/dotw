Final Project and Other Assignments

Outline for Final Project

I want to create 3 panels each with a different scene. I kind of thought of this during a trip to the Armory. There was an artwork with 3 panels of flowing water. I thought it would be cool to use the 3 panel idea to show different sceneries of places I've been. Perhaps to show contrast? I want to make the middel panel just an image of the visitor (webcam). The first panel will show videos of where different places, and third panel will show different people. When the user clicks the panels will switch what they show. Different types of music will play in the background. I also want to recreate this one sculpture that I saw. It was this beautiful dangling cube with geometric shapes carved into it. In the middle was a light that would cast the images onto the wall. I'll place this above the 3 panels just as kind of a light source for the images, and try to dim the surrounding. I want to be able to allow users to interactivyl move the cube so that it shines light at different areas in a 2D way (I'm not sure if 3D can handel the videos but if it can that would be awesome).
