<!-- This drawing was based off a few panels I saw at the armory. Each panel depicted one part of an entire scene. I tried recreating this by placing divs in front of a video. Then using javascript to move the divs. 
The most time consuming part was making sure that the divs dissappeared and reappeared correctly. I did this by
decreasing the width as the div left the screen. The armory work seemed super peaceful and thats a main feeling i wanted to recreate. -->
